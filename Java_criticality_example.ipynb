    "The file that has been created through the above process now contains an attribute for criticality (Criticality score) and length of road (LoR score). The next step is to use this file and assign impact scores. This can be done by either creating a function that will loop through different scenarios or by simply saving the file and manually assigning impact scores within a GIS software (e.g. Qgis) if there are not too many scenarios to consider. Then, by multiplying the Criticality score, LoR score, and the Impact score, a Road Segment Disruption Score (RSDS) is obtained that quantifies the disruption (in a relative sense) for any given road segment. Summing the RSDS across all affected road segments will then give a Road Network Disruption Score (RNDS), which gives an indiciation of the overall network disruption to the entire road network by a given scenario. The RNDS scores can then be compared across different scenarios, allowing one to compare and rank the potential disruption of different scenarios. "
